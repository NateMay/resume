          >
          completing his capstone mastery course in UX Research and Design,
          while earning a what is effectively a graduate-level minor in
          Entrepreneurship out of the engineering school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through his Entrepreneurship courses, Nate has developed his ability
          to understand <em>WHY</em> and <em>FOR WHOM</em> solution are needed,
          as well as <em>WHICH</em> solutions are worth pursuing. Through his
          Design courses he learned the process for discoving <em>WHAT</em> can
          be created to solve such problems. Finally, the UCAD courses he took helped
          him round out his development skills to address <em>HOW</em> to create such
          solutions.

          Originally, Nate majored in Finance with a minor in Computer Science
          (CS) to pursue algorithmic trading. Impressed by the Accounting
          program, he decided to complete a few extra classes for the Accounting
          degree as well. The engineering department made it difficult to enroll
          in classes as a minor so Nate was forced to convert his CS minor into
          informatics in his final semester. In his Sophomore year, Nate was
          admitted into the
          <a href="https://techmgmt.illinois.edu/" target="_blank"
            >Hoeft Technology and Management</a
          >
          minor which selects 25 business and 25 engineering students to both
          cross-train in the otherâ€™s curriculum and collaborate in
          interdisciplinary courses.
