          Nate is currently completing the curriculum for 3 tracks within the
          MSI program:

            target="_blank"
            >Big Data Analytics</a
          >. A web developer by trade, Nate expects the UX curriculum to
          complement his existing technical skills. The Big Data Analytics track
          will expand his capabilities as a full stack developer and enable him
          with statistical modeling, machine learning, and the python language
          more broadly. Currently, he plans to choose User-Centered Agile
          Development as his area of focus to reflect his deeper skillset.

          Originally, Nate majored in Finance with a minor in Computer Science
          (CS) to pursue algorithmic trading. Impressed by the Accounting
          program, he decided to complete a few extra classes for the Accounting
          degree as well. The engineering department made it difficult to enroll
          in classes as a minor so Nate was forced to convert his CS minor into
          informatics in his final semester. In his Sophomore year, Nate was
          admitted into the
          <a href="https://techmgmt.illinois.edu/" target="_blank"
            >Hoeft Technology and Management</a
          >
          minor which selects 25 business and 25 engineering students to both
          cross-train in the otherâ€™s curriculum and collaborate in
          interdisciplinary courses.
